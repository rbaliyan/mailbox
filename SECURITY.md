## Reporting a Vulnerability

We use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting**.

Please **do not** open a public issue for security bugs. Instead:

1. Go to the **Security** tab of this repository.
2. Click on **Advisories** on the left sidebar.
3. Click **Report a vulnerability**.

This allows you to share the details privately with me.
